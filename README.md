# Iris-Classification-WebApp

This Iris classification project involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their characteristics, specifically the measurements of their sepals and petals. The iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, contains samples of iris flowers belonging to three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset Description:
A. Features (Attributes):
a. Sepal Length (in cm)
b. Sepal Width (in cm)
c. Petal Length (in cm)
d. Petal Width (in cm)
B. Target (Labels):
a. Iris Setosa
b. Iris Versicolor
c. Iris Virginica
Goal:
The goal of the iris classification task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower given its sepal and petal measurements.
